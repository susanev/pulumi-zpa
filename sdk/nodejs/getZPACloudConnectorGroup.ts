/**
 * Use the **zpa_cloud_connector_group** data source to get information about a cloud connector group created from the Zscaler Private Access cloud. This data source can then be referenced within an Access Policy rule
 *
 * > **NOTE:** A Cloud Connector Group resource is created in the Zscaler Cloud Connector cloud and replicated to the ZPA cloud. This resource can then be referenced in a Access Policy Rule where the Object Type = `CLOUD_CONNECTOR_GROUP` is being used.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as zpa from "@pulumi/zpa";
 *
 * const foo = zpa.getZPACloudConnectorGroup({
 *     name: "AWS-Cloud",
 * });

 * import * as zpa from "@pulumi/zpa";
 *
 * const foo = zpa.getZPACloudConnectorGroup({
 *     id: "1234567890",
